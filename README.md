# 🌦️ Updated Weather App

The **Updated Weather App** is a full-stack weather application that provides real-time weather updates for any city in the world. It is built using modern web technologies and integrates with a weather API to display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions in a clean and user-friendly interface.

## 🌍 Overview
